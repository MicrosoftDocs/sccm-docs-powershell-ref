## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-CMBoundaryFromGroup** cmdlet removes a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager boundary from a boundary group.
A boundary is a network address range, subnet, or Active Directory site that identifies a group of computers that are close in the network.
A boundary group is a collection of boundaries.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a boundary from a group by using the boundary name
```
PS C:\> Remove-CMBoundaryFromGroup -BoundaryGroupID "16777219" -BoundaryName "CLBound03"
```

This example removes a boundary named CLBound03 from a boundary group that has the ID 16777219.

### Example 2: Remove multiple boundary groups by using an InputObject
```
PS C:\> $BoundaryObj = Get-CMBoundary -Name "Bound01", "Bound02", "Bound03"
PS C:\> Remove-CMBoundaryFromGroup -Boundary $BoundaryObj -BoundaryGroupName "BGroup02"
```

The first command uses the **Get-CMBoundary** cmdlet to get multiple boundaries that are specified by their names, and stores this data into the **$BoundaryObj** variable.

The second command identifies and removes the boundaries that are specified by using the input object **$BoundaryObj**.
Because the *Force* parameter is not specified, you must confirm the action before it is performed.

## PARAMETERS

### -BoundaryGroupId
Specifies an ID for the boundary group from which you remove a boundary.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Id, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Id, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Id
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BoundaryGroupInputObject
```yaml
Type: IResultObject
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Object, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Object, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Object
Aliases: BoundaryGroup

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BoundaryGroupName
Specifies a name for the boundary group from which you remove a boundary.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Name, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Name, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Name
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BoundaryId
Specifies an ID for the boundary that this cmdlet removes.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Id, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Name, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupById_Object
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BoundaryInputObject
```yaml
Type: IResultObject
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Id, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Name, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByObject_Object
Aliases: Boundary

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BoundaryName
Specifies a name for the boundary that this cmdlet removes.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Id, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Name, RemoveBoundaryFromGroupByName_Object
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableWildcardHandling
DisableWildcardHandling treats wildcard characters as literal character values. Cannot be combined with **ForceWildcardHandling**.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ForceWildcardHandling
ForceWildcardHandling processes wildcard characters and may lead to unexpected behavior (not recommended). Cannot be combined with **DisableWildcardHandling**.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
