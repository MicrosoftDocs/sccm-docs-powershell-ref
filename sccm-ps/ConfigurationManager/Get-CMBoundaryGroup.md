# Get-CMBoundaryGroup

## SYNOPSIS

Get a boundary group.

## SYNTAX

### SearchByName (Default)
```
Get-CMBoundaryGroup [-Name <String>] [-DisableWildcardHandling] [-ForceWildcardHandling] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### SearchByIdMandatory
```
Get-CMBoundaryGroup -Id <String[]> [-DisableWildcardHandling] [-ForceWildcardHandling] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Use the **Get-CMBoundaryGroup** cmdlet to get a boundary group. A boundary group is a collection of boundaries.

You can use boundary groups to manage network locations. Before you can use the boundary group, assign boundaries to boundary groups .
Boundary groups enable client computers to find a primary site for client assignment, and a list of available site systems that have content.
For more information about boundaries, see [Overview of boundaries and boundary groups in Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/define-site-boundaries-and-boundary-groups).

> [!NOTE]
> Run Configuration Manager cmdlets from the Configuration Manager site drive, for example `PS XYZ:\>`. For more information, see [getting started](/powershell/sccm/overview).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get a boundary group that is specified by its name

This command gets a boundary group that is specified by the name **BGroup01**.

```powershell
Get-CMBoundaryGroup -Name "BGroup01"
```

### Example 2: Get multiple boundary groups that are specified by ID

This command gets multiple boundary groups that are specified by the identifiers `5` and `6`.

```powershell
Get-CMBoundaryGroup -Id 5,6
```

### Example 3: Show all Boundary Groups and their Settings:

This command shows all Boundary Groups and their configured settings.

```powershell
Get-CMBoundaryGroup | Format-Table Name, GroupID, `
  @{ N = "AllowPeerDownloads"; E = { -not ($_.Flags -band 1) } }, `
  @{ N = "SubnetOnly"; E = { ($_.Flags -band 2) -eq 2 } }, `
  @{ N = "PreferDistributionPoint"; E = { ($_.Flags -band 4) -eq 4 } }, `
  @{ N = "PreferCloud"; E = { ($_.Flags -band 8) -eq 8 } }
```
