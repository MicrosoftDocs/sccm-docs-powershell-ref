# Remove-CMFileReplicationRoute

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a file replication route from Configuration Manager.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-CMFileReplicationRoute -SourceSiteCode <String> -DestinationSiteCode <String> [-Force]
 [-DisableWildcardHandling] [-ForceWildcardHandling] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-CMFileReplicationRoute** cmdlet removes a file replication route from Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager.
System Center Configuration Manager uses file replication routes to transfer file-based data between sites in a hierarchy.
Each file replication route identifies a destination site to which file-based data can transfer.

File replication routes were known as addresses in versions of Configuration Manager before System Center Configuration Manager.
The functionality of file replication routes is the same as that of addresses in earlier versions.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a file replication route
```
PS C:\> Remove-CMFileReplicationRoute -DestinationSiteCode "IM5" -SourceSiteCode "IM1"
```

This command removes a file replication route from the site that has the site code IM1 to the site that has the site code IM5.
