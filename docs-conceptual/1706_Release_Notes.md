# System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1706

 >[!NOTE]
 > System Center Configuration Current Branch 1702 is the baseline for these changes. See [System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1702](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/configurationmanager/1702_release_notes) for more details.

## Important changes
### Documentation library updates
Up-to-date Cmdlet Library documentation is now available from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/configurationmanager/vlatest/configurationmanager.

### Administrator console Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) experience improvements
The script that is generated when launching ISE from the administrator console has been updated to allow for more customization and reusability. 

If a script has been previously generated, it must be removed from ```%APPDATA%\TEMP``` for the new script to be created.

### Removed cmdlets
The following cmdlets are no longer supported and have been removed:
- Add-CMComplianceRegistrySetting
- New-CMComplianceRule

## How to provide feedback or report issues
Many of the fixes and improvements described in this document are a result of customer feedback. To leave feedback and bug reports, use

## Known issues
These are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that are not resolved in this release.

### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy and Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy
64-bit PowerShell environment is required for these cmdlets.

#### Workaround

- None

### New-CMWirelessProfile and Set-CMWirelessProfile
Cmdlets may fail if run in a 64-bit PowerShell environment.

#### Workaround

- Run these cmdlets in a 32-bit PowerShell environment.

### Add-CMDataWarehouseServicePoint and Set-CMDataWarehouseServicePoint
Cannot set schedule to run "Daily"

#### Workaround

- None

### Import-CMSecurityRole
Cmdlet may fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException error locating the file ```SecuredRoles.xsd```.

#### Workaround
Ensure that ```Import-Module``` is called against the ```ConfigurationManager.psd1``` file, and not the logical path or module name.

### New-CMApplicationDeployment and New-CMClientSettingDeployment
Cmdlet allows for combining the **CollectionName**, **Collection**, and **CollectionId** parameters thus causing undefined behavior.

#### Workaround
Specify only **CollectionName**, **Collection**, or **CollectionId**. Do not combine these parameters.

### Remove-CMStateMigrationPoint
Cmdlet may fail with an ArgumentOutOfRangeException when removing a State Migration Point if there is content hosted by the site role.

#### Workaround
Directly remove the state migration point from the SMS Provider.
``` powershell
$smp = Get-CMStateMigrationPoint ... # Get the state migration point
$smp.Delete() # Directly delete the object.
```

$setting = $ci | Get-CMComplianceSetting -SettingName "hiberfile.sys must have system attribute" # Get the SDK setting object
$rule = $setting | New-CMComplianceRuleFileFolderAttribute -RuleName "hiberfile.sys must be system" -System $true # Create the rule
$ci | Add-CMComplianceSettingRule $rule # Bind the rule to the CI
```

}
```

#### Example 2: Install an update and monitor its status

while($true) {
    cls
    $update | Get-CMSiteUpdateInstallStatus -Step All -Complete | select orderid, progress, description -Last 10 | ft
    sleep 5
}
```

$clause1 = New-CMDetectionClauseWindowsInstaller -ProductCode $guid [Value -ExpressionOperator IsEquals -ExpectedValue "1.1.1.1" # Do a version check
$clause2 = New-CMDetectionClauseDirectory -DirectoryName "mymsi" -Path "C:\" -Existence # c:\mymsi should exist
$app | Add-CMMsiDeploymentType -ContentLocation "\\myserver\mypath\mymsi.msi" -Force -AddDetectionClause ($clause1, $clause2)
```

#### Notes
It is not currently supported to modify detection clauses in place. 

It is not currently supported to group or ungroup detection clauses.

### Task sequences
New cmdlets have been added to support modifying task sequence steps and groupings.

- Task sequence groups and steps
    - Get/New/Remove/Set-CMTaskSequenceGroup    
    - Add/Get/Remove-CMTaskSequenceStep
- Task sequence conditions (Get and New verbs supported)
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionIfStatement
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionQueryWmi
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionRegistry
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionFile
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionFolder
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionOperatingSystem
    - CMTaskSequenceStepConditionSoftware
- Task sequence commands (Get, New, Remove, and Set verbs supported)
    - CMTaskSequenceStepRunCommandLine
    - CMTaskSequenceStepInstallApplication
    - CMTaskSequenceStepInstallSoftware

#### Example: Create a custom task sequence that runs two PowerShell scripts
``` powershell
$step1 = New-CMTaskSequenceStepRunPowerShellScript -Name "Run script 1" -PackageID $PackageId -ScriptName "script1.ps1" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
$step2 = New-CMTaskSequenceStepRunPowerShellScript -Name "Run script 2" -PackageID $PackageId -ScriptName "script2.ps1" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
$ts = New-CMTaskSequence -Name "Run scripts" -CustomTaskSequence
$ts | Add-CMTaskSequenceStep -Step ($step1, $step2)
```

#### Note
Additional task sequence commands to be added in a future release.

### iOS Bulk Enrollment
New cmdlets have been added to support iOS bulk enrollment scenarios.

- Get-CMCorpOwnedDevice
- Get-CMIosEnrollmentProfile
- New-CMIosEnrollmentProfile
- Remove-CMCorpOwnedDevice
- Remove-CMIosEnrollmentProfile
- Set-CMIosEnrollmentProfileAssignment

### Wireless profiles
New cmdlets have been added to support wireless profiles.
- Get-CMWirelessProfile
- New-CMWirelessProfile
- Remove-CMWirelessProfile
- Set-CMWirelessProfile

### Deployment cmdlets
New cmdlets have been added to support additional deployment scenarios.
- New-CMClientSettingsDeployment 
    - Supersedes ```Start-CMClientSettingsDeployment```
- New-CMApplicationDeploymentSimulation 
    - Supersedes ```Start-CMApplicationDeploymentSimulation```

### Resource tracking and recovery (BETA)
New cmdlets have been added to support tracking SMS Provider objects used by the PowerShell runtime, and to clean up these resources when they are no longer needed.

- Disconnect-CMObject
- Start-CMObjectTracking
- Stop-CMObjectTracking

When ```Start-CMObjectTracking``` is run, the PowerShell runtime will track ```IResultObject``` objects created by Cmdlet Library cmdlets. Cmdlets that are not manually cleaned up with ```.Dispose()``` can be reclaimed by using ```Disconnect-CMObject``` against an individual object (example: ```$o | Disconnect-CMObject```), or ```Disconnect-CMObject -All``` can be used reclaim _all_ tracked objects. 

Note that once an object is reclaimed, it can no longer be reused or passed to another cmdlet through the object pipeline. 

```Stop-CMObjectTracking``` can be used to turn off object tracking. Note that previously allocated objects will remain active.

Unclaimed resources can cause Quota Violation errors to be raised by the SMS Provider. These issues typically manifest from working with very large sets of SMS Provider objects or in very long running environments

#### Notes
This is an experimental feature and may be subject to change or removal in a future release. This feature is opt-in and is not enabled by default.

### Get-CMClientHealthSummary
This cmdlet can be used to get client health information for a collection with an optional date range.

#### Example: Gets client health for "All Systems" starting in January, 2017.
``` powershell
Get-CMCollection -Name "All Systems" | Get-CMClientHealthSummary -StartDate "2017/01/01"
```
### Get-CMSoftwareUpdateSyncStatus
This cmdlet can be used to get the status of a synchronization with Windows Update.

### Invoke-CMContentRedistribution
This cmdlet can be used to redistribute content that has already been deployed to a distribution point. This supports application, package, boot image, software update, driver, image, task sequence, and operating system content distributions.

#### Example: Redistribute a package to a distribution point
``` powershell
Get-CMPackage -Name Contoso | Invoke-CMContentRedistribution -DistributionPointName myserver.contoso.com
```

### Invoke-CMDeploymentSummarization
This cmdlet can be used to immediately perform deployment summarization.

### Stop-CMMigrationSource
This cmdlet can be used to stop a site migration from occurring. ```Sync-CMMigrationSource``` must be used to resume migration.
