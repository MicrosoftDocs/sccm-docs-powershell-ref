# System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1610

 >[!NOTE]
 > The 1604 version of the System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet
 > Library is the baseline for these changes.

## Important changes
### Administrator console allows for launching the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)
From the administrator console, an additional option was added to launch the ISE: "Connect via Windows PowerShell ISE".

### Cmdlet update check
The Cmdlet Library will no longer check for updated versions. This check is no longer necessary since the Cmdlet Library now ships simultaneously with Configuration Manager releases.

### Get-CM* cmdlets may support "Fast" mode and may return a warning if it is not used
Some Get cmdlets now have a *Fast* parameter. This parameter allows the cmdlet to return objects without automatically refreshing lazy properties. Retrieving lazy property values can cause additional network traffic and can slow down cmdlet execution. If lazy properties are not used, Fast should be supplied as a cmdlet parameter.

To provide visibility into this change, cmdlets that support *Fast* will write a warning to the console if it is not used in a case where its presence may be beneficial. This warning can be suppressed by setting `$CMPSSuppressFastNotUsedCheck = $True`.

## Known issues
These are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that are not resolved in this release.

### Cannot import ConfigurationManager.psd1 module by using the logical name
If the path to the ConfigurationManager.psd1 module is added to the PSMODULEPATH environment variable, it cannot be imported by using Import-Module ConfigurationManager.

#### Workaround
*  Use the full path to the module
*  https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Make-Configuration-Manager-04474a87

    > [!NOTE]
    > This workaround is supplied by the user community and is not tested or supported by Microsoft.

### Add-CMEnrollmentProxyPoint
Cmdlet may not properly configure the enrollment proxy point if there are multiple enrollment points for the primary site, or if the enrollment point is on a separate server.

#### Workaround
*  Use the administrator console for this configuration.

### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy/Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy
64-bit PowerShell environment is required for these cmdlets.

####  Workaround
*  None

```

## Cmdlet changes
The following changes have been made to existing cmdlets for this release. Changes may be new functionality, bug fixes, or deprecations, and may be breaking. If you use one of the cmdlets or feature areas listed in this section, please carefully review the changes to understand how they may affect your use.

### Miscellaneous changes
#### Bugs that were fixed
Deployment type cmdlets that require a *Url* parameter may not validate the parameter value for correctness (for example, **Add-CMGooglePlayDeploymentType**, **Set-CMWindowsPhoneStoreDeploymentType**).

Deployment type cmdlets that support Mobile Application Management (MAM) may not add these details to the application model causing the "App Configuration Policies" tab to be missing from the administrator console.

Add-CM<*technology*>DeploymentType cmdlets do not create deployment types using the same naming convention as the administrator console.

Deployment type cmdlets that require a file instead of a file path (for example, **Add-CMMsiDeploymentType**) will now report a clearer failure cause if an unexpected argument is specified for the *ContentLocation* parameter.

#### Non-breaking changes
Provider data representing \__GENERIC WMI objects now display more data to the Windows PowerShell console.

### "Connect via Windows PowerShell ISE" from administrator console
#### Bugs that were fixed
The generated script did not run because of an invalid path to the ConfigurationManager module. If an invalid script has already been generated, remove the existing %TEMP%\ISEConnect_sitecode - sitename.ps1 file and relaunch the ISE from the administrator console.

The generated script may be unreadable when an administrator console language pack is installed. If an invalid script has already been generated, remove the existing %TEMP%\ISEConnect_sitecode - sitename.ps1 file and relaunch ISE from the administrator console.

An invalid path error may be raised when launching the ISE from the administrator console.

### Add-CMDeploymentType
#### Bugs that were fixed
Cmdlet may return an "Unexpected site version" warning.

### Add-CMDeviceCollectionQueryMembershipRule
#### Bugs that were fixed
Cmdlet does not verify the validity of the query specified by the *QueryExpression* parameter.
Cannot create query rules with duplicate names (does not align with administrator console behavior).

### Add-CMDriverToDriverPackage
#### Bugs that were fixed
Pipelined object may be disposed by the cmdlet.

### Add-CMEndpointProtectionPoint
#### Bugs that were fixed
Adding an endpoint protection point for the first time to a site may result in an incorrect default client settings configuration.

### Get-CMSiteRole
#### Breaking changes
When connected to a primary site and no *SiteCode* parameter is specified, only roles specific to the connected site will be returned. This change was made to have parity and consistency with the administrator console. For instance, if you have a CAS and are running the cmdlet on a primary site, only site roles for the current site code will be used. Site roles for all sites will be returned when running from a CAS.

To restore the previous behavior, the *AllSites* parameter can be used to query all sites within the hierarchy from any connected site.
