## Known issues
The following items are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that aren't resolved in this release.

### Get-CMDevice
Cmdlet may not return expected properties for a device.

>[!NOTE]
> This issue is currently scheduled to be addressed in a future update rollup.

#### Workaround
- Specify **CollectionName**, **CollectionId**, or **Collection** parameter value.

### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy and Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy
64-bit PowerShell environment is required for these cmdlets.

#### Workaround
- None

### Import-CMSecurityRole
Cmdlet may fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException error locating the file ```SecuredRoles.xsd```.

#### Workaround
- Make sure that ```Import-Module``` is called against the ```ConfigurationManager.psd1``` file, and not the logical path or module name.

### Set-CMSoftwareUpdatePoint
Changes to **Schedule** may not be shown in the Configuration Manager console even though the underlying SMS Provider object has been changed.

#### Workaround
- Quit and relaunch the Configuration Manager console.

### Resource tracking and recovery (BETA)
New cmdlets have been added to support tracking SMS Provider objects used by the PowerShell runtime, and to clean up these resources when they're no longer needed.

- Disconnect-CMObject
- Start-CMObjectTracking
- Stop-CMObjectTracking

When ```Start-CMObjectTracking``` is run, the PowerShell runtime will track ```IResultObject``` objects created by Cmdlet Library cmdlets. Cmdlets that aren't manually cleaned up with ```.Dispose()``` can be reclaimed by using ```Disconnect-CMObject``` against an individual object.

#### Example
```powershell
# Reclaim all tracked objects
$o | Disconnect-CMObject```), or ```Disconnect-CMObject -All
```

Once an object is reclaimed, it can no longer be reused or passed to another cmdlet through the object pipeline.

```Stop-CMObjectTracking``` can be used to turn off object tracking. Previously allocated objects will remain active.

Unclaimed resources can cause Quota Violation errors to be raised by the SMS Provider. These quota issues typically manifest from working with large sets of SMS Provider objects or in long running environments.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature and may be subject to change or removal in a future release. This feature is opt-in and isn't enabled by default.
