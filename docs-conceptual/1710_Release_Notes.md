# System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1710

 >[!NOTE]
 > System Center Configuration Current Branch 1706 is the baseline for these changes. See [System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1706](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/configurationmanager/1706_release_notes) for more details.

## Important changes
### Documentation library updates
Up-to-date Cmdlet Library documentation is now available from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/configurationmanager/vlatest/configurationmanager.

### Removed cmdlets
The following cmdlets are no longer supported and have been removed:
- Invoke-CMAmtProvisioningDiscovery
- New-CMAmtProvisioningAccount
- Set-CMPowerControl

### Deprecated cmdlets
- ```Invoke-CMEndpointProtectionScan``` and ```Save-CMEndpointProtectionDefinition``` have been superseded by ```Invoke-CMClientAction```.

### Disable PSDrive auto-creation
When the ConfigurationManager.psd1 module is loaded, PowerShell automatically attempts to create a connection to the last SMS Provider that was accessed using the Configuration Manager console. In some scenarios, this behavior may not be desirable. A per-user registry key has been added that can disable this behavior and require manual drive creation. To configure this, use the registry key: ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ConfigMgr10\PowerShell``` and set the value ```DisableCMDriveAutoCreate``` to a DWORD of 1 (drive auto-creation is disabled) or 0 (default behavior). Deleting ```DisableCMDriveAutoCreate``` also enables default behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> When drive auto-creation is disabled, the Configuration Manager console may report an error when launching a PowerShell window.

## Known issues
These are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that are not resolved in this release.

### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy and Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy
64-bit PowerShell environment is required for these cmdlets.

#### Workaround
- None

### Import-CMSecurityRole
Cmdlet may fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException error locating the file ```SecuredRoles.xsd```.

#### Workaround
Ensure that ```Import-Module``` is called against the ```ConfigurationManager.psd1``` file, and not the logical path or module name.

### Get-CMSiteUpdateInstallStatus
Cmdlet may fail with a WqlQueryException error.

#### Workaround
- Use Invoke-CMWmiQuery to directly query the SMS_CM_UpdatePackTopLevelMonitoring class.

##### Example
```powershell
# Note: The PackageGuid value can be determined by running Get-CMSiteUpdateInstallStatus -Verbose and viewing the query details.
Invoke-CMWmiQuery "SELECT * FROM SMS_UpdatePackTopLevelMonitoring WHERE PackageGuid='...' ORDER BY StageId ASC"
```

### Set-CMSoftwareUpdatePoint
Changes to **Schedule** may not be reflected in the Configuration Manager console even though the underlying SMS Provider object has been changed.

#### Workaround
Quit and relaunch the Configuration Manager console.

## New cmdlets
These are newly-added cmdlets for this release that add new functionality or enhance the functionality of existing cmdlets.

### Device association cmdlets
```Get-CMResultantCollection``` will get the collections associated with a device.
```Get-CMResultantDeployment``` will get the deployments targeted to a device.

### Client inventory class management
New cmdlets have been added to support modifying inventory classes used for client inventory.
- Get-CMInventoryClass
- New-CMInventoryReportClass

### Task sequences
New cmdlets have been added to support modifying task sequence steps.
- Task sequence commands (Get, New, Remove, and Set verbs supported)
    - CMTaskSequenceStepApplyOperatingSystem
    - CMTaskSequenceStepApplyWindowsSetting

### Resource tracking and recovery (BETA)
New cmdlets have been added to support tracking SMS Provider objects used by the PowerShell runtime, and to clean up these resources when they are no longer needed.

- Disconnect-CMObject
- Start-CMObjectTracking
- Stop-CMObjectTracking

When ```Start-CMObjectTracking``` is run, the PowerShell runtime will track ```IResultObject``` objects created by Cmdlet Library cmdlets. Cmdlets that are not manually cleaned up with ```.Dispose()``` can be reclaimed by using ```Disconnect-CMObject``` against an individual object.

#### Example
```powershell
# Reclaim all tracked objects
$o | Disconnect-CMObject```), or ```Disconnect-CMObject -All
```

Note that once an object is reclaimed, it can no longer be reused or passed to another cmdlet through the object pipeline.

```Stop-CMObjectTracking``` can be used to turn off object tracking. Note that previously allocated objects will remain active.

Unclaimed resources can cause Quota Violation errors to be raised by the SMS Provider. These issues typically manifest from working with very large sets of SMS Provider objects or in very long running environments

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature and may be subject to change or removal in a future release. This feature is opt-in and is not enabled by default.
