# System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1802

 >[!NOTE]
 > System Center Configuration Current Branch 1710 is the baseline for these changes. For more information, see [System Center Configuration Manager Cmdlet Library changes for Current Branch 1710](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/configurationmanager/1710_release_notes).

## Important changes
### Administrator console no longer creates hard link for PowerShell module
The administrator console installer has been updated to allow for importing the ConfigurationManager module by logical name without using a hard link from ```<installdir>\bin\ConfigurationManager``` to ```<installdir>\bin```.

### Deprecated cmdlets
- ```New-CMGlobalCondition``` and ```Set-CMGlobalCondition``` have been superseded by the [new family of global condition cmdlets](#gccmdlets).

### Disable PSDrive auto-creation
When the ConfigurationManager.psd1 module is loaded, PowerShell automatically tries to create a connection to the last SMS Provider that was accessed using the Configuration Manager console. In some scenarios, this connection behavior may not be desirable. A per-user registry key has been added that can disable this behavior and require manual drive creation. To configure the behavior, use the registry key: ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ConfigMgr10\PowerShell``` and set the value ```DisableCMDriveAutoCreate``` to a DWORD of 1 (drive auto-creation is disabled) or 0 (default behavior). Deleting ```DisableCMDriveAutoCreate``` also enables default behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> When drive auto-creation is disabled, the Configuration Manager console may report an error when launching a PowerShell window.

## Known issues
The following items are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that are not resolved in this release.

### New-CMCloudDistributionPoint
Cmdlet is currently non-functional.

#### Workaround
- None

### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy and Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy
64-bit PowerShell environment is required for these cmdlets.

#### Workaround
- None

### Import-CMSecurityRole
Cmdlet may fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException error locating the file ```SecuredRoles.xsd```.

#### Workaround
- Make sure that ```Import-Module``` is called against the ```ConfigurationManager.psd1``` file, and not the logical path or module name.

### Set-CMSoftwareUpdatePoint
Changes to **Schedule** may not be shown in the Configuration Manager console even though the underlying SMS Provider object has been changed.

#### Workaround
- Quit and relaunch the Configuration Manager console.

## New cmdlets
The following items are newly added cmdlets for this release that add new functionality or enhance the functionality of existing cmdlets.

### Co-Management cmdlets
```New-CMCoManagementPolicy``` will allow for creation of a co-management policy.

### <a name="gccmdlets"></a>Global condition cmdlets
New cmdlets have been added to support creating and modifying global conditions. New, and Set verbs are supported.
- CMGlobalConditionActiveDirecotryQuery
- CMGlobalConditionAssembly
- CMGlobalConditionFile
- CMGlobalConditionIisMetabase
- CMGlobalConditionRegistryKey
- CMGlobalConditionRegistryValue
- CMGlobalConditionScript
- CMGlobalConditionSqlQuery
- CMGlobalConditionWqlQuery
- CMGlobalConditionXPathQuery
- CMGlobalConditionOmaUri

### Task Sequence cmdlets
New cmdlets have been added to support modifying task sequence steps.
- Task sequence commands (Get, New, Remove, and Set verbs supported)
    - CMTSCaptureNetworkSettings
    - CMTSCaptureSystemImage
    - CMTSCaptureUserState
    - CMTSCaptureWindowsSetting
    - CMTSConvertDisk
    - CMTSDisableBitLocker
    - CMTSEnableBitLocker
    - CMTSPrepareSmsClient
    - CMTSPrepareWindows
    - CMTSStepApplyDataImage
    - CMTSStepDownloadPackageContent
    - CMTSStepJoinDomainWorkgroup
    - CMTSStepOfflineEnableBitLocker
    - CMTSStepPrestartCheckAction
    - CMTSStepRestoreUserState
    - CMTSStepUpgradeOperatingSystem

- Task sequence condition commands
    - ```New-CMTSStepConditionOperatingSystemLangauge``` cmdlet for creation of an operating system language condition.

- Task sequence copying cmdlets
    - ```Copy-CMTaskSequence``` cmdlet for creating a copy of an existing task sequence.

### Convert-CMDeploymentType
This cmdlet allows for getting a native ```DeploymentType``` object from an ```SMS_DeploymentType``` WMI object instance. Can be combined with ```Get-CMDeploymentType```.

### Resource tracking and recovery (BETA)
New cmdlets have been added to support tracking SMS Provider objects used by the PowerShell runtime, and to clean up these resources when they're no longer needed.

- Disconnect-CMObject
- Start-CMObjectTracking
- Stop-CMObjectTracking

When ```Start-CMObjectTracking``` is run, the PowerShell runtime will track ```IResultObject``` objects created by Cmdlet Library cmdlets. Cmdlets that aren't manually cleaned up with ```.Dispose()``` can be reclaimed by using ```Disconnect-CMObject``` against an individual object.

#### Example
```powershell
# Reclaim all tracked objects
$o | Disconnect-CMObject```), or ```Disconnect-CMObject -All
```

Once an object is reclaimed, it can no longer be reused or passed to another cmdlet through the object pipeline.

```Stop-CMObjectTracking``` can be used to turn off object tracking. Previously allocated objects will remain active.

Unclaimed resources can cause Quota Violation errors to be raised by the SMS Provider. These quota issues typically manifest from working with large sets of SMS Provider objects or in long running environments.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature and may be subject to change or removal in a future release. This feature is opt-in and isn't enabled by default.
