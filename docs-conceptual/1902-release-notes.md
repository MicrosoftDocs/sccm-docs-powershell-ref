## Known issues

The following items are known issues with the Cmdlet Library that aren't resolved in this version.


### Get-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy and Set-CMAadConditionalAccessPolicy

These cmdlets require a 64-bit PowerShell environment.

#### Workaround
- None


### Import-CMSecurityRole

Cmdlet may fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException error locating the file `SecuredRoles.xsd`.

#### Workaround
- Call `Import-Module` against the `ConfigurationManager.psd1` file, and not the logical path or module name.


### Set-CMSoftwareUpdatePoint

Changes to **Schedule** may not be shown in the Configuration Manager console even though the underlying SMS Provider object has been changed.

#### Workaround
- Quit and relaunch the Configuration Manager console.


### Resource tracking and recovery (beta)

This version adds new cmdlets to support tracking SMS Provider objects used by the PowerShell runtime, and to clean up these resources when they're no longer needed.

- Disconnect-CMTrackedObject
- Start-CMObjectTracking
- Stop-CMObjectTracking

When you run `Start-CMObjectTracking`, the PowerShell runtime tracks `IResultObject` objects created by Cmdlet Library cmdlets. For cmdlets that aren't manually cleaned up with `.Dispose()`, reclaim them by using `Disconnect-CMTrackedObject` against an individual object.

#### Example
```powershell
# Reclaim a single tracked object
$o | Disconnect-CMTrackedObject

# Reclaim all tracked objects
Disconnect-CMTrackedObject -All
```

Once an object is reclaimed, it can no longer be reused or passed to another cmdlet through the object pipeline.

`Stop-CMObjectTracking` can be used to turn off object tracking. Previously allocated objects remain active.

Unclaimed resources can cause the SMS Provider to raise quota violation errors. These quota issues typically manifest from working with large sets of SMS Provider objects or in long-running environments.

> [!NOTE]  
> This feature is experimental and may be subject to change or removal in a future release. It's opt-in and isn't enabled by default.
